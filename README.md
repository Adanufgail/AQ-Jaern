Rewrite/Update of Adventure Quest: Jaern Manual for home campaign.

Adventure Quest: Jaern was created by Daniel M. Lawrence and Robert J. Blake. Following Dan's passing in 2010, the rights to Adventure Quest passed to Greg Mowczko, who allowed the Purdue Fantasy Club to create a rewrite to fit their house rules. Their version was released under a CC 4.0 A-NC-SA license, and it is in that same respect that my version is being produced. I will do my best to preserve the intent of the work while correcting several inconsistencies I have found in the manual, as well as including many things that were not directly mentioned but were included in the game during my time with the Lafayette Simulations Gaming group at Purdue from 2008 through 2013.

\textbf{INTRODUCTION}

\textbf{Adventure Quest\textsuperscript{TM}} (\textbf{AQ} for short) is a role playing system in which you, through your game persona (adventurer), can experience all the thrills and perform deeds of derring-do in a fantasy world. It is like being the hero in an adventure novel, only, instead of just reading about what happens, your actions and decisions direct the storyline. You can destroy evil maidens, rescue fair dragons, or even be a knight in very dull armor. Your imagination is the only limit to what you can do while playing Adventure Quest.

As a player, you create an adventurer which you control. Another person, called the Game Master (GM), presents to you and other players a fantasy world of cities, towns, creatures, oppressive overlords, demanding temples, and lots of magic and treasure. You tackle adventures in this world to satisfy the personality and motives of your adventurer. Adventure Quest tm provides adventure in a variety of different settings (Games), each with its own history, customs, inhabitants, villains, and deities. 

This Game Guide covers adventuring in JAERN, a distant fantasy world far in our future. Other Adventure Quest games include AQ/BRITANNIA, describing a world similar to the British Isles in the mid 1200’s; AQ/KHEMET, providing adventure in a land akin to ancient Egypt; AQ/FREEZONE, a coorporate ruled gangland in the near future; and AQ/SPACE, for adventuring in the outer reaches of Interstellar Space among the Pan-Human Hegemony.

\textbf{Realism and Playability}

Adventure Quest/Jaern is a complete game; you do not have to buy any other books before beginning play. It contains all the necessary information for players to create and play their adventurers, and for Game Masters to design and maintain a campaign. Any game such as this must strike some kind of balance between realism and playability. The mechanics used in this manual lean heavily towards the latter, with the idea that you should spend your time roleplaying your creations, be you a player or Game Master, rather than wading through very complex rules for the sake of realism.

That said, we realize that some of you might be willing to make a different tradeoff. Where appropriate, optional rules are included offering different, but more complex, mechanics that arguably provide greater realism. The players and Game Master may choose which options to include to tailor the game to their liking. The cornerstone of \textbf{Adventure Quest\textsuperscript{TM}} games are flexibility. Much of the game book deals with the creation of personalities, creatures, magical items, etc. Examples are provided that you can use as is, but more importantly we tell you how to create your own that will automatically be balanced with the system.

\textbf{About Role Playing}

Playing Adventure Quest, like any role playing game, should be a fun and exciting experience. Your adventurer will likely encounter many unusual, exotic, and strange situations, people, and activities. Your adventurer may end up in conflict with, or allied to, an array of intelligent beings and creatures, many of which we might consider strange or even evil by today’s standard and mores. Please remember that this is "just a game." The authors in no way endorse or suggest that you act out any game-related actions or methods in the real world. Practice safe gaming, and leave the game and any enemies you make there behind you at the gaming table.

\textbf{How to Use this Book (TODO: UPDATE CHAPTER NUMBERS)}
\begin{itemize}
\item All players and Game Masters should read Chapters 1 through 4 which deal with the creation and playing of adventurers.
\item Chapters 5 through 10 describe the world of Jaern, the setting for this game, and is therefore also pertinent for both players and Game Masters.
\item Chapters 11 through 27 present the magic available in AQ/Jaern. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter 11 discusses nomadic mystiscism. 
\item Chapters 12 through 16 deal with elemental magic, and are therfore of primary interest to players whose adventurers use magician spells.
\item Chapters 17 through 27 deal with divine magic. Each deity has its own chapter, so these are of interest to any player whose adventurer follows a particular god or goddess.
\end{itemize}
\item Chapters 28 through 35 are meant primarily for the Game Master. They discuss creation of actors, creatures, and treasures, designing interesting and exciting adventures, adjudicating adventures, and how to maintain a campaign.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Original Acknowledgements}

The list below is really just the beginning. Many people have contributed in different ways at different stages of this project. We would especially like to thank Mark Shoemaker for lots of zany ideas and style over many years, Bob Ferguson for his devotion in filling out thousands of forms, to Scott Delaney for fixing all our cars, to Tony Charlesworth for his endless time researching a world full of information, to Greg Mowzko for not letting a single error problem by no matter how insufferable it was, to Microsoft for their Access product that holds all of our databases, and to our good roleplaying friends in Lake Geneva, for providing us the motivation.

Robert J. Blake, my coauthor of this system, created most of the elemental spells, a lot of creatures, many skill descriptions and provided a sounding board for all the basic concepts behind our system. He provided endless encouragement to bring this project to pass. Robert ran the AD\&D Open Tournement at the Gencon Gaming convention for over a decade, overseeing uncountable details of scenario design and game master coordination. It was his experience which made it possible for us to create this system. Also our work on these concepts found its place in improving other systems in many ways. Sadly, we lost Robert at the beginning of the new millenium. He will be greatly missed.

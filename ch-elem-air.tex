\section{Air}

Magicians devoted to the Air element spend much of their time out of doors where they may feel the power of the wind and the subtleties of light breezes. Some dismiss Air magicians as flighty and fickle, but they are the most cerebral of the elemental magicians.

\ul{Air Magic} typifies the power of the element, in spells like Lightning Bolt and Anaerobia, and the ability to manipulate the element.

\ul{Vision} spells enhance the seeing ability of the magician.

\ul{Scrying} spells are information-gathering magics.

\ul{Dimensions} involve summoning or sending items to or away from the caster. Because of the great power that must be channeled to use these spells, they are more difficult to learn, and draining to the magician. The base costs for these spells is \tcdefine{600 EP}.

\subsection{Air Magic}

\spellentry{Minibolt}{1}{1 Round}{None}{LOS 60 + 15/Finesse Feet}{Instantaneous}{1 object or creature}{\tcdieroll{1d6} damage}{Sends a small electrical charge from the air blasting towards the target. A Minibolt always hits the target, but magical resistance can negate or reduce the damage (GM's discretion).}

\spellentry{Gust}{2}{1 Round}{None}{60 + 10/Finesse Feet}{1 Minute}{5 x (20 + 10/Finesse)' line}{30 + 10/Finesse mph gust}{Produces a blast of air in the area of effect sufficient to extinguish unprotected flames, fan a large fire, etc.}

\spellentry{Arise}{3}{1 Round}{None}{Caster}{\tcdieroll{2d6} + 1/Finesse Rounds}{Caster}{Accelerate 4 + 1/Finesse Feet /Rounds}{Allows the caster to float into the air like a kite. While concentrating, the caster can accelerate up or down, but is at the mercy of winds and other forces that could cause lateral movement. The caster cannot carry more than they can normally lift above their head.}

\spellentry{Fresh Air}{4}{1 Round}{None}{0}{\tcdieroll{1d4} + 1/Finesse Rounds}{10 + 5/Finesse Feet Radius}{Freshen air}{Cleanse a volume of fetid, putrid, or poisonous air to make it breathable. The purified area can move with the caster if they so choose.}

\spellentry{Ironlungs}{5}{1 Round}{\tcdieroll{4d6} vs \PWR negates}{Touch}{10 + 3/Finesse Minutes}{1 creature}{Hold breath}{The target can hold their breath for the spell's duration. Total concentration by the target is necessary, so Ironlungs prevents most forms of spell casting.}

\spellentry{Lightning Bolt}{6}{1 Round}{\tcdieroll{3d6} vs \HEA for 1/2}{LOS 120 + 30/Finesse Feet}{Instantaneous}{4 + 1/Finesse Feet wide line}{\tcdieroll{6d6} damage}{Create opposed electrical charges between the caster's fingertip and their intended target, causing a bolt of electrical energy to travel from their finger to the target along the path of least resistance. Intervening objects and people along this path are affected by the bolt, as is the target.}

\spellentry{Fly}{7}{1 Round}{\tcdieroll{4d6} vs \PWR negates}{LOS 20 + 5/Finesse Feet}{\tcdieroll{4d6} + 6/Finesse Rounds}{1 humanoid}{Fly 120 + 30/Finesse Feet /Rounds}{The target is able to fly. Simple actions can be performed without penalty while in flight, but weapon attacks are made at a penalty (GM's discretion) and spell casting is impossible. The target cannot carry more than they could lift above their head.}

\spellentry{Wind}{8}{4 Rounds}{None}{0}{6 + 3/Finesse Hours}{60 + 20/Finesse Feet Radius}{Control wind}{Control the speed and direction of the wind. The wind is strong enough to propel a sailing vessel if desired, although a sail is an obvious necessity.}

\spellentry{Air Temperature}{9}{2 Rounds}{None}{90 + 20/Finesse Feet}{6 + 2/Finesse Hours}{60 + 20/Finesse Feet Radius}{Change temperature}{Change the temperature in the chosen area. Current weather effects are modified by the change, as dictated by common sense. Air Temperature can be targeted on the caster or another person, and the area of effect will move with that person.}

\spellentry{Anaerobia}{10}{1 Round}{\tcdieroll{4d6} vs \PWR negates}{LOS 20 + 10/Finesse Feet}{\tcdieroll{4d20} + 8/Finesse Minutes}{1 creature}{Survive without air}{This spell satisfies the target's need for oxygen, making normal breathing unnecessary. All actions may be performed normally. Anaerobia does not protect the target from possible physical damage caused by hostile environments, such as fire, extreme cold, etc.}

\spellentry{Hawksoar}{11}{1 Round}{\tcdieroll{4d6} vs \PWR negates}{Touch}{15 + 4/Finesse Rounds}{1 humanoid}{Fly and attack}{Hawksoar adds the abilities of combat and spell casting to the Fly spell. All actions are allowable and not subject to any penalties.}

\spellentry{Ekblovego}{12}{3 Rounds}{\tcdieroll{5d6} vs \STR for half}{0}{\tcdieroll{1d6} + 1/Finesse Rounds}{30'x(150 + 30/Finesse)' line}{Massive wind blast}{Create a massive blast or gust of wind. All free standing objects and creatures are blown backwards 80 feet and suffer \tcdieroll{1d6} \DP each round they remain in the effect. Some structural damage to buildings may even result (GM's discretion).}

\spellentry{Vacuum}{13}{3 Rounds}{\tcdieroll{4d6} vs \HEA}{100 + 30/Finesse Feet}{Instantaneous}{30 + 10/Finesse Feet Radius}{Remove air}{Creates an airless space in the area of effect. Aerobic creatures who fail the \RC become comatose. Fires are immediately extinguished, sailing vessels becalmed, and other processes involving air are likewise halted. The GM will adjudicate any side-effects of the sudden decompression.}

\spellentry{Blitzen}{14}{2 Rounds}{\tcdieroll{4d6} vs \AGI for half}{160 + 40/Finesse Feet}{8 + 2/Finesse Rounds}{15 + 5/Finesse Feet Radius}{1 lightning strike/Rounds}{Causes lightning to strike the indicated area once each round. All creatures in the area of effect are hit and suffer \tcdieroll{6d6} \DP for each attack. If the magician is casting this during a thunderstorm, all base parameters are doubled.}

\spellentry{Aerovoki}{15}{4 Rounds}{None}{40 + 10/Finesse Feet}{4 + 1/Finesse Minutes}{Special}{Summon air elementals}{Summon \result{\tcdieroll{\tcdieroll{1d6}}+1} air elementals to any point within the caster's range. Air must be available. The elementals will serve the caster, even in combat. They will not turn on them, but will make note of who summoned them. There is a \tcdieroll{1d10} chance on each successive summoning that the elementials will attempt to take the caster with them at the end of the spell.}

\spellentry{Wrath}{16}{4 Rounds}{\tcdieroll{5d6} vs \HEA for half}{160 + 40/Finesse Feet}{4 + 1/Finesse Minutes}{Up to 1/4 met Radius}{Summon wind storm}{Summon a wind storm of unbelievable strength. It can be in the form of a hurricane, tornado, or a straight line wind. Wind velocity is 300 mph or more, few structures will survive (the GM may give stone buildings an \RC). Each round in the effect, creatures suffer \tcdieroll{3d6} \DP from being struck by flying debris. Spell casting is impossible. The \RC must be made each round.}

\subsection{Vision}

\spellentry{Murk}{1}{1 Round}{\tcdieroll{3d6} vs \PER negates}{20 + 5/Finesse Feet}{\tcdieroll{1d20} + 4/Finesse Rounds}{10 + 5/Finesse Feet Radius}{Reduce visibility}{Causes dust motes in the environment to coalesce onto water droplets to create a dirty, murky area. Vision is reduced by \tcdefine{40 + 10/Finesse Feet}. Murk is effective in underwater as well as air.}

\spellentry{Distortion}{2}{1 Round}{None}{None}{\tcdieroll{1d20} + 4/Finesse Minutes}{5 + 2/Finesse Feet Radius}{Obscure vision}{Bends and shifts light rays erratically in the area of effect, causing forms within the area become blurry, indistinct, and are 90\% unrecognizable.}

\spellentry{Crystal}{3}{1 Round}{None}{20 + 5/Finesse Feet}{\tcdieroll{1d4} + 1/Finesse Minutes}{10 + 5/Finesse Feet Radius}{Increase visibility}{Cleansing the air of impurities clinging to water droplets. It is only effective in haze, fog, murky water, etc.}

\spellentry{Glamor}{4}{2 Rounds}{\tcdieroll{4d6} vs \WIL negates}{Touch}{\tcdieroll{1d20} + 1/Finesse Minutes}{1 creature}{Boost \COM 2 + 1/Finesse}{Alters the natural \COM of the target, affecting reactions accordingly.}

\spellentry{Intuit}{5}{2 Rounds}{None}{Caster}{\tcdieroll{1d20} + 1/Finesse Minutes}{Caster}{Boost \PER 2 + 1/Finesse}{Temporarily increase their \PER for the duration of the spell.}

\spellentry{One Eye}{6}{1 Round}{\tcdieroll{3d6} vs \PWR negates}{20 + 5/Finesse Feet}{\tcdieroll{1d8} + 2/Finesse Rounds}{1 creature}{Blind one eye}{Temporarily blinds target in one eye (caster's choice). The target's melee modifiers are reduced by \result{2 + 1/Finesse} to reflect the loss of depth perception. If the target only had one eye to begin with, it will become totally blind.}

\spellentry{Discovery}{7}{2 Rounds}{None}{Caster}{\tcdieroll{1d20} + 4/Finesse Minutes}{Caster}{Magnify 8 + 2/Finesse times}{See minute things or details that escape normal vision. Rolls against \PER are made with \tcdefine{one less die} than normal.}

\spellentry{Parallax}{8}{1 Round}{None}{0}{\tcdieroll{1d8} + 2/Finesse Rounds}{Caster}{Boost DV by 2 + 1/Finesse}{The caster's body seems to shift about suddenly. Attackers must try to correct for the sudden parallax error, in effect raising all the caster's DVs.}

\spellentry{Long Eyes}{9}{2 Rounds}{None}{0}{\tcdieroll{1d6} + 2/Finesse Minutes}{Caster}{Closer 8 + 2/Finesse times}{See distant objects as if they are much closer. They must have LOS, and certain atmospheric conditions (e.g. fog, haze, precipitation, etc.) can reduce the effectiveness by \result{1/2x}. This also will increases the range of other LOS spells cast during \textbf{Long Eyes} duration. Finneses to increase the range of these spells are appled \ul{before} \textbf{Long Eyes} multiples the range.}

\spellentry{Heat Vision}{10}{2 Rounds}{\tcdieroll{4d6} vs \PWR negates}{Touch}{\tcdieroll{1d20} + 4/Finesse Minutes}{1 creature}{See heat @ 40 + 10/Finesse Feet}{See infrared instead of (NOT in addition to) light. Objects will vary in color from jet black (very cold) to bright red (very hot). A cold draft or emanations from ice interfere with heat vision by making forms opaque.}

\spellentry{Night Sight}{11}{2 Rounds}{None}{Caster}{\tcdieroll{1d4} + 1/Finesse Minutes}{Caster}{See in the dark}{See in natural darkness and shadows as well as in bright moonlight. If the effect is fully finessed they can even see in magical darkness or shadows.}

\spellentry{Invisibility}{12}{1 Round}{\tcdieroll{4d6} vs \PWR negates}{Touch}{5 + 2/Finesse Minutes}{1 object or creature}{Make unseeable}{Surrounds the target with a magical field which shifts light out of phase. If the field is touched by an ungrounded physical object, the spell is broken. An invisible person can walk about or open doors, but cannot drop or pick up anything nor physically attack. Spells which have a physical manifestation break the enchantment. Invisible creatures are in the same phase and can see one another.}

\spellentry{Sight License}{13}{1 Round}{\tcdieroll{4d6} vs \PWR negates}{Touch}{8 + 3/Finesse Hours}{1 creature}{Allows sight}{Temporarily grants the target the power of sight, even if it is blind or lacks sight organs.}

\spellentry{Blind}{14}{1 Round}{\tcdieroll{4d6} vs \PWR negates}{LOS 20 + 5/Finesse Feet}{Permanent}{1 creature}{Remove vision}{Makes the target blind until cancelled by the caster or \textbf{Revoked}. The target must be capable of vision for the spell to be effective, i.e., Blinding a worm is of little consequence.}

\spellentry{Projection}{15}{4 Rounds}{None}{0}{5 + 2/Finesse Minutes}{LOS 250 + 100/Finesse Feet}{Create mass vision}{All people and/or creatures in the area of this spell see just what the caster desires them to see. The vision appears quite real, but has no audio, temperature or touch components. The caster MUST maintain concentration for the duration of this spell, or the vision disappears immediately.}

\spellentry{See All}{16}{4 Rounds}{None}{Caster}{12 + 4/Finesse Rounds}{Caster}{Create LOS}{See through one solid object or creature. This can be as small as a rabbit or as large as a mountain, but can be only one thing. Thus the caster can cast a line of sight spell through any interposing creature or object subject to that spell's normal range restrictions.}

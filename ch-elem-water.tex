\chapter{Water Magic}
\label{ch:elemental-water-magic}

Water magicians are interested in the properties of all liquids, but are especially drawn to the rivers and oceans of Jaern.
Like the ocean, they seem timeless, with an inevitability to their actions.

Water Magic typifies the power of the element, in spells like Well and Ocean Cold, and the ability to manipulate the element.

Changings allow the magician or target to assume a different physical form.

Wardings provide protection to creatures and objects.

Charms are used to impose the caster's will on living creatures. Because of the great power that must be channeled to use these spells, they are more difficult to learn, and drain their user. Their base cost is 600 EP.

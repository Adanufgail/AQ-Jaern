\begin{multicols*}{2}
\skillentry{Accounting}{INT}{Auger}{130}{4}{Keeping track of accounts and expenditures is important to the merchants and the larger establishments. Creative accounting also can be profitably employed among the less ethical.}
\skillentry{Acrobatics}{AGI}{Marine}{200}{2}{Useful for gymnastic flips, jumps, leaps, and swings. An adventurer can jump into, or backflip out of, melee. They could jump from a second story window into the street and gain a free round on an opponent. Acrobatics cannot be performed in any sort of metal armor.}
\skillentry{Acting}{INT}{Nomad}{100}{2}{An adventurer with acting skill has some understanding of how to assume a role and stay in character. The GM must assign difficulties and appropriate checks for this skill based on circumstances.}
\skillentry{Ambidextrous}{AGI}{Warrior}{150}{2}{An adventurer can use either hand as their primary attack hand. Adventurers, by default, have the same "handedness" as their player. If the adventurer's primary hand is incapacitated or damaged, this skill will let them fight using their secondary hand as if it were their primary hand. Normally, using a weapon in the secondary hand causes the adventurer to suffer a \result{-4} penalty on any to "to \indy{strike}" roll. Roll \tcdieroll{1d6} for each minus you wish to cancel against the skill rank. If successful, subtract the number of dice rolled from the \result{-4} penalty.}
\skillentry{Ambush}{INT}{Auger}{150}{2}{If your adventurer knows a person or group is coming, and if they are totally unaware of their presence or intentions, they can set an ambush for them. The GM will determine the amount of time necessary to set the ambush. Roll the skill rank or less on \tcdieroll{2d6}. If successful, the adventurer gets \tcdieroll{1d3} \ul{free rounds before normal combat} begins.}
\skillentry{Analyze Trap}{INT}{Auger}{150}{N/A}{An adventurer uses this skill to learn the workings of a set or unset trap. Most traps require a \colorbox{white!40!GreenYellow}{2d6} check against this skill to analyze successfully. If successful, subtract two dice from any attempt to disarm that trap. The GM may set a different roll for success depending on the difficulty of the trap.}
\skillentry{Animal Calling}{HEA}{Auger}{80}{2}{Ever needful of quick gratification, this skill has been the boon to many lonely travelers. Out in the forests or fields, the sound of the skill user's voice lures unsuspecting woodland and field animals to the side of the caller, ready to become target practice, dinner, a new floor rug, or to meet even a more distasteful fate.}
\skillentry{Animal Husbandry}{CSE}{Auger}{120}{3}{Domesticated animals (horses, cows, sheep, pigs, jkarr'n, ichitle, etc.) are needed in large numbers for food, transportation and work. Understanding how to raise these creatures successfully is a profitable profession.}
\skillentry{Animal Training}{WIL}{Nomad}{200}{N/A}{The ability to train mammals to perform on command is regulated by the rank of this skill. It is useful in adventuring, or as a profession.}
\skillentry{Archeology}{INT}{Auger}{100}{N/A}{This skill lets your adventurer use archeological methods and techniques, but does not give any historical information. Studying days or months on a site, they can determine patterns of lifestyle, diet, wealth, and other generalizations about the ancient inhabitants. On a spot examination, if you succeed the check against this skill, the race, time era, and other simple elementary data about the ancient inhabitants can be learned.}
\skillentry{Architecture}{INT}{Auger}{65}{3}{Architecture involves the planning and design of buildings. An architect can also give advice on structural weaknesses and suggest repair options, if feasible. Architects always keep building plans as references for future work.}
\skillentry{Armor Smithing}{INT}{Auger}{65}{2}{This skill is necessary to create and repair armor of all types. This includes some knowledge of working leather, iron, copper, fabrics, sewing and fastenings. Creating good quality armor of normal manufacture usually requires a two dice check, though temporarily repairing damaged armor in the field usually requires a \tcdieroll{1d6} check (GM discretion)}
\skillentry{Arson}{INT}{Auger}{50}{2}{This is the ability to set fire to something and make it appear to have occurred naturally. The GM sets the number of \tcdieroll{d6} for the player to roll against the skill. If successful, anyone investigating the scene of the fire must make a PER check at \tcdieroll{2d6} more than usual to detect the arson.}
\skillentry{Artillery}{INT}{Marine}{200}{2}{Ballistas, catapults and other artillery weapons are complex to load, aim and fire. An engineer or other adventurer may increase their skill using these weapons. This skill is a combination of different loading and firing styles that gives the artilleryman flexibility. Any \ul{ONE} of these options can be used in one round. Since most of these weapons are very similar to use, this one skill can be applied to using any of artillery piece.\\

\indy*{Quickload}: The Quickload option lets the artilleryman load their weapon faster. Each round they are  loading an artillery piece, or directing a team loading the weapon, if they can roll \tcdieroll{2d6} and get their \result{artillery rank or less}, that counts as 2 rounds of loading. They \ul{can not} load and fire in the same round using this option.\\

\indy{Long Shot}: Knowing just how much to overwind, change aperture sizes or otherwise stress their weapon, the experienced artilleryman can make a Long Shot to increase range. They choose the number of dice for an attempted shot, and roll them. If the total is their \result{artillery skill or less}, then their range increases by 25\% of the original range for \result{each die} rolled. But this is not without danger. Any "roll to \indy{hit}" \result{of 1} indicates that they have overstressed their artillery piece, and it falls to pieces, possibly injuring those about it.\\

\indy{Lethal Attack}: A steady hand and a good eye helps the artilleryman make a difficult Lethal Attack and increase the damage. Choosing a number of dice, the player rolls those dice. Getting a total of their \result{artillery skill or less} makes the number they need to get a \indy{Critical Hit} on their "roll to \indy{strike}" one less for \result{each die} rolled. \example{If they roll three dice and succeed, they will score a critical hit on a 17 or better on their "roll to strike."}\\

\indy{Precise Attack}: Being able to very carefully set the angle and elevation of their weapon relative to the target, and in spite of the rolling deck, is what allows an artilleryman to make a Precise Attack and increase accuracy. The player picks a number of dice, making the check against against their weapon skill. If this succeeds they may add \result{+2 for each dice} used in the check to the value of their "roll to \indy{strike}" during this round.}
\skillentry{Artistry}{CSE}{Auger}{80}{4}{Painting, sculpting, dancing, or executing any form of artistic expression requires this skill to avoid being laughed out of town as a rube or charlatan.}
\skillentry{Assassination}{AGI}{Warrior}{500}{N/A}{This skill represents an organized and prepared attempt to kill a target. The preparations must be arranged at least \measure{1 hour} prior to the attack. Guards, security precautions, disguises, access to the site before the attempt and the accessibility of the target will all influence the number of dice which the GM will assign to the attempt. For physical melee attacks, if successful, the attacker rolls on the assassination column of the appropriate \indy{critical wound} table (see \apref{critical-hits} on \tcpage{critical-hits}). If the check fails, the attacker makes a normal melee roll instead. For other styles of killings, like poisonings and "arranged" accidents, the GM will determine the results of a success or a failure.}
\skillentry{Astrology}{INT}{Nomad}{250}{RES}{The trained astrologer looks at the position of the stars and the planets in the night sky. Some believe that future events can be divined by someone with this skill. The astrologer states what they are attempting to divine, and the GM assigns a number of \tcdieroll{d6} to roll against the skill rank for them to convince onlookers that what they says will come to pass.}
\skillentry{Astronomy}{INT}{Auger}{115}{N/A}{Looking at the skies and cataloging the movements of the stars and planets is the province of the astronomer. This skill is needed to understand the movements of the heavens, and is often learned by sages, navigators, and nomad fortune readers.}
\skillentry{Balance}{AGI}{Marine}{50}{2}{This ability is used to walk thin ledges, ropes, narrow walkways, etc. without falling. The GM may also ask for a check against balance when an adventurer tries many physical maneuvers that would test the balance of a normal person.}
\skillentry{Barber}{AGI}{Auger}{15}{2}{Barbers cut hair and perform other personal grooming services. Wealthy citizens frequently train their own barber, or hire one skilled in these duties. Many free-lance barbers work out of the \indy{Natatorium}.}
\skillentry{Barristry}{INT}{Auger}{115}{RES}{The barristry skill is useful if legal representation is needed, or if proper legal documents must be executed and filed. Such services can be quite costly, and many barristers grow rich from the legal woes of others.}
\skillentry{Bartending}{CSE}{Auger}{30}{2}{The art of mixing palatable combinations of liquers and listening endlessly to repetitive conversation is important to those who must tend bars at various inns and taverns over the whole of Jaern.}
\skillentry{Battle Axe}{CSE}{Weapon}{360}{N/A}{Skilled usage of Battle Axe grants the abilities listed under \indy[weapon!combat skill]{Combat Weapon Skills} on \tcpage{skill-combat-weapon}}
\skillentry{Belching}{HEA}{Marine}{100}{2}{This skill has been brought to a fine art by bored marines who have been eating the onboard cooking too long. A high rank in this skill allows the talented belcher to sound off entire songs.}
\skillentry{Binding}{CSE}{Auger}{50}{3}{When binding a target, choose how many more dice to add to the check for escape. Roll that many \tcdieroll{d6}; if you get your adventurer's \result{skill rank or less}, the bound person must add that many dice to a \tcdieroll{2d6} check against the escape skill to break free.}
\skillentry{Blacksmithing}{STR}{Auger}{65}{3}{A blacksmith is skilled in forming utilitarian items from iron, such as nails, horseshoes, chains, etc. They are also experienced at attaching iron fittings to leather, and thus can fabricate and adjust horse tack and dolphin harnesses.}
\skillentry{Bludgeon}{AGI}{Auger}{165}{N/A}{Bludgeon is the ability to knock an unsuspecting target \indy{unconscious} by striking them from behind with a \indy{blunt} instrument. The bludgeoner must position themselves behind the target without the target having \ul{heard, seen or being aware} in any way of the attacker. The GM will adjudicate the difficulty of the bludgeon based on factors such as alertness of the target, prevailing light conditions, and other distractions. If successful, roll on the \apref{critical-hits-bludgeon} Table on \tcpage{critical-hits-bludgeon}. If the skill check fails, roll "to \indy{strike}" against the target. If this roll succeeds, the target takes damage as normal (resolving all proper criticals and modifiers). If the roll "to \indy{strike}" fails, the target of the bludgeon gets 1 free round to act before combat continues.}
\skillentry{Boarding}{AGI}{Marine}{100}{2}{This is the ability to move safely and quickly from one ship to another, especially to a \ul{hostile} vessel. This may involve lots of rope swinging, careful jumping, and rigging running, which are all encompassed in this skill.}
\skillentry{Botany}{INT}{Auger}{30}{N/A}{Botany is necessary to understand and implement the requirements for healthy plant growth. A botanist can advise on proper fertilization, watering, pruning, etc., as well as diagnose and perhaps cure plant diseases.}
\skillentry{Bow}{CSE}{Weapon}{180}{N/A}{Skilled usage of Bow grants the abilities listed under \indy[weapon!Missile skill]{Missile Weapon Skills} on \tcpage{skill-combat-missile}}
\skillentry{Brewing}{INT}{Auger}{80}{RES}{This skill has been carefully handed down, parent to child, since antiquity. The secrets of using just the right materials to assure the proper fermentation of the grains have been closely held by those in the brewers guild. This profession is highly profitable to one who can find a way to gain admittance to its ranks.}
\skillentry{Bricklaying}{INT}{Auger}{50}{2}{Mixing, laying and mortaring bricks is vital to the construction of new buildings and public works. The bricklayer is in demand on all such construction projects, both making the bricks and laying them out carefully along the wall lines and areas specified by the architect.}
\skillentry{Build Trap}{INT}{Auger}{250}{N/A}{Anyone wanting to build and arm mechanical traps should have this skill. Magical effects can be bound to such traps using the rules for creating magical items.}
\skillentry{Business Management}{CSE}{Auger}{50}{2}{Operating a successful business is key to turning a continual profit. This skill allows an individual to operate as a shop keeper and sales person, to hire and manage employees, and to negotiate with suppliers.}
\skillentry{Butchering}{CSE}{Auger}{30}{2}{This skill is necessary for the efficient cutting of an animal carcass into usable meat. A \indy{butcher} (i.e., one who uses this skill as a profession) can identify spoiled meat before others can, and is an expert at putting a razor sharp edge on a knife.}
\skillentry{Camouflage}{CSE}{Auger}{50}{2}{This skill is the deliberate and specific concealment of one or more persons in the wild. A substantial amount of time may be required to gather and prepare all the needed materials. As a guide, allow \tcdieroll{3d6}+3 turns per person to be concealed.}
\skillentry{Candlemaking}{INT}{Auger}{15}{2}{Basic candlemaking involves the repetitive dipping of a fabric wick in tallow to create a long lasting light source.}
\skillentry{Carpentry}{INT}{Auger}{50}{2}{This skill is crucial to the construction of wooden objects, buildings, or vehicles. The proper use of tools, materials and knowledge of their joinings allow the hard working carpenter to make a reasonable living from their craft. Attempts to create or repair wooden items can be adjudicated by checks against this skill.}
\skillentry{Cartography}{INT}{Marine}{100}{3}{Cartography is the making, care, reading, copying, and interpretation of maps. A successful \tcdieroll{1d6} skill check is required to read the basics of a map well enough to follow established paths and roadways. Without this skill, a \tcdieroll{4d6} check versus \INT is required. To travel off the beaten path with the aid of a map, a player needs to make a successful \tcdieroll{2d6} skill check (as well as a successful \indy{Orienteering} check to keep from getting lost).}
\skillentry{Cartwrighting}{INT}{Auger}{50}{3}{A cartwright posses special carpentry skills to assemble and repair carts and wagons. They \ul{cannot make wooden wheels}, however.}
\skillentry{Climbing}{STR}{Marine}{100}{2}{This skill is used for climbing ropes, scaling rough walls, etc. The GM will set the difficulty of the check based on the circumstances of the climb.}
\skillentry{Club}{CSE}{Weapon}{120}{N/A}{Skilled usage of Club grants the abilities listed under \indy[weapon!combat skill]{Combat Weapon Skills} on \tcpage{skill-combat-weapon}}
\skillentry{Cobbling}{INT}{Auger}{50}{2}{Cobbling is the construction and repair of leather footwear. The amount of time required and the difficulty of the check depends on the type of footwear. A pair of rope-soled sandals take about \measure{1 day}, whereas a pair of thigh length, jacer hide boots with secret compartments in the heels and soles could take \measure{2 weeks or more}.}
\skillentry{Combat Weapon Skills}{CSE}{Special}{0}{0}{\label{skill-combat-weapon}An adventurer may increase their ability with hand-to-hand weapons. This skill combines five different maneuvers and fighting styles to give the wielder flexibility in their attack. Any \uline{one} of these options may be used in a round. A player may buy combat weapon skills for each weapon their adventurer uses. Base costs are listed by weapon in the skill list in \chref{create-skills} on \pageref{create-skills}.\\

\indy{Quickdraw} is used to pull a weapon and get 1 normal attack with that weapon in the same round. The player rolls \tcdieroll{2d6}; if the total equals the \result{corresponding weapon skill or less}, their adventure pulls the weapon and gets one normal attack in that round.\\

\indy{Multi-Attack} makes more than one attack per round possible when the adventurer is in combat and has their weapon ready. The player makes a check of \tcdieroll{1d6} for \ul{each} desired additional attack against their weapon skill. If they fail, they gets a single attack. If successful, they may attempt the \result{number of die rolled +1} attacks, \ul{one at a time}, stopping when they are used up or when an attack fails to strike the target. Attacks may be directed at any target(s) currently engaged in melee with the adventurer.\\

\indy{Precise Attack}: A Precise Attack increases attack accuracy and can be used whenever the adventurer has their weapon ready. The player picks a number of dice, making the check against their weapon skill. If this succeeds they may add \result{+2} for each die used in the check to the value of their single "to \indy{strike}" roll during the round.\\

\indy{Lethal Attack}: A Lethal Attack adds +2 DP per die of the check to the damage done by a successful attack. The adventuerder must have their weapon ready, and choose the number of dice for the attempt.\\

\indy{Effective Attack}: An Effective Attack is similar to a Lethal Attack,
except the warrior adds +1 to the "to \indy{strike"} roll and +1 DP to
the damage roll for \ul{each} die in the skill check.}
\skillentry{Composing Music}{CSE}{Nomad}{250}{0}{Creating melody, harmony and rhythm from the chaos of life all around, the composer puts quill to paper to creae music that they and others can perform.}
\skillentry{Cooking}{INT}{Auger}{15}{2}{This skill allows the preparation of edible and attractive foods and drinks. A check of \tcdieroll{2d6} is reasonable to prepare a plain but tasty meal. A check of \tcdieroll{4d6} is appropriate to prepare a successful feast for a large crowd, or to make a very exotic dish.}
\skillentry{Coopering}{INT}{Auger}{65}{2}{A cooper fashions watertight wooden containers, such as barrels, kegs, buckets, etc. The skill includes the ability to select the proper wood, make beveled joints, and use metal bands to clamp and reinforce the item.}
\skillentry{Courtesan}{COM}{Auger}{115}{2}{This skill is used to please other people in various physical and sexual ways. Skill as a evening companion and well as the well directed use of lust are included within. A check of \tcdieroll{2d6} is considered when attempting to please a companion. A check of \tcdieroll{3d6} vs this skill is usual for attempting to entice someone into a situation, but remember the circumstances can cause the GM to modify this check.}
\skillentry{Crossbow}{CSE}{Weapon}{270}{N/A}{Skilled usage of Crossbow grants the abilities listed under \indy[weapon!Missile skill]{Missile Weapon Skills} on \tcpage{skill-combat-missile}}
\skillentry{Cyphering}{INT}{Auger}{115}{N/A}{Cyphering is encoded writing. It is frequently used in business correspondence, communication with the \indy{Assassins Guild}, and between \indy{maraujo captains}. Cyphering can be used to create or break codes. To create a code, the player selects a number of \tcdieroll{d6} to roll against the skill rank. If they gets their adventurer's \result{skill rank or less} the code is \result{useable}, and the number of \tcdieroll{d6} rolled becomes the code's \indy{difficulty rating}. If the check is failed, the code is flawed and will yield gibberish or misleading statements if used.\\

To break a code, the player rolls a number of \tcdieroll{d6} equal to their adventurer's cyphering rank. The GM rolls a number of \tcdieroll{d6} equal to the code's difficulty. The higher total wins, i.e., if the player is higher they break the code, and if the GM is higher, the code remains insolvable. If the player knows the key word or phrase used to construct the code, the player rolls a number of \tcdieroll{d6} equal to \tcdieroll{1d6 less} than the code's difficulty \example{(if the code is difficulty 6, the player rolls \tcdieroll{5d6} and the GM \tcdieroll{6d6})} regardless of their adventurer's cyphering rank. The role of player and GM can of course be reversed in the above examples if an actor is trying to break a player-created code.}
\skillentry{Dagger Fighting}{CSE}{Marine}{120}{N/A}{Skilled usage of Dagger grants the abilities listed under \indy[weapon!combat skill]{Combat Weapon Skills} on \tcpage{skill-combat-weapon}}
\skillentry{Dagger Throwing}{CSE}{Marine}{60}{N/A}{This proficiency skill assists in targeting thrown daggers. Roll the number of dice equal to the bonus desired. If the total is equal to or less than your adventurer's skill rank, add \result{that bonus} to the "to \indy{hit}" roll, but \ul{not} the damage roll.}
\skillentry{Dancing}{AGI}{Nomad}{100}{1}{The dancing skill is used to execute pleasing footwork patterns and body motions, usually to musical accompaniment. Success at this skill indicates the dancer has enjoyed the activity and has appeared to be competent at the appropriate level of difficulty depending on the assigned skill check (GM discretion, considering the intricacy of the dance).}
\skillentry{Detect Traps}{PER}{Auger}{150}{4}{This skill allows an adventurer to observe a \ul{suspicious} area and determine if, and how, it is trapped. The area must be in the adventurer's LOS, and the difficulty of the check depends not only on how cunningly the trap design is but also visibility.}
\skillentry{Diagnosis}{INT}{Auger}{80}{RES}{Someone adept at diagnosis can determine what is physically wrong with a person, though a remedy or treatment suggestion is \ul{outside} the scope of this skill. Diagnosis can be developed into a very lucrative profession when used in conjunction with the nomadic herbology skill.}
\skillentry{Disarm Trap}{INT}{Auger}{250}{N/A}{Having identified a trap by some means, this skill allows one attempt to disarm it. Average mechanical traps require a \tcdieroll{2d6} check to successfully disarm. Magic, technology, and trap difficulty can all change this check at the GM's discretion. Failure to disarm may trigger the trap (GM discretion).}
\skillentry{Disguise}{INT}{Auger}{50}{3}{This is the ability to skillfully apply makeup, false beards, etc., and select and wear clothing to change one's outward appearance. The GM will determine the difficulty of the check based on how much the desired result varies from the physical characteristics of the adventurer. Simply adding a beard is very easy, but to disguise a human as another race can be exceedingly difficult.}
\skillentry{Diving}{STR}{Marine}{50}{2}{Diving allows an adventurer to properly dive into water from greater heights, or into shallow water, with less chance of injury than someone without it. As a base, an unskilled person cannot dive into less than 10 feet of water safely, and will likely be injured if diving from a height of more than 10 feet. The GM determines the difficulty of the skill check. A dive from 30 feet into 10 feet of water would be a \tcdieroll{2d6} check against the skill; dives from greater heights or into shallower water increases the difficulty. The depth of the dive may also be adjusted with this skill. Normal dive depth is 10 feet, regardless of height. If the adventurer wishes he may have the depth of the dive equal the height of the dive to a maximum of 30 feet; minimum depth is two feet. Such depth changes add \tcdieroll{1d6} to the skill check.}
\skillentry{Dodging}{AGI}{Marine}{200}{4}{This skill allows your adventurer to dodge incoming missiles. This is done in the opponent's round when the GM is about to roll "to \indy{strike}" your adventurer. When the GM asks for their \MDV, announce that they are  dodging, and roll the number of dice equal to the number you wish to increase their \MDV. If successful, state the \MDV \result{plus the number of dice rolled}. Otherwise, state the MDV \result{minus the number of dice rolled.}}
\skillentry{Dolphin Speech}{INT}{Marine}{300}{N/A}{Some believe dolphins are as intelligent as humans, but most think of them more like children. Dolphins communicate among themselves with a series of clicks, whistles, and grunts. Over time people can learn to understand and even "speak" some of the simpler "words." Trying to convey a simple idea, or understand one spoken by a dolphin, requires a successful \tcdieroll{2d6} check against this skill. Your GM will modify this roll depending on the complexity of the communication, and the current circumstances.}
\skillentry{Dolphin Training}{CSE}{Marine}{400}{RES}{Dolphins can become very intelligent and loyal mounts if skillfully trained. Dolphin trainers are highly prized and sought by Maraujo cefos to train their cavalries, and can demand and get high fees for their services.}
\skillentry{Dolphinship}{AGI}{Marine}{200}{3}{This skill allows an adventurer to control and ride a properly trained and harnessed dolphin. Riding a dolphin at half the creature's speed through a calm sea (\mets{35}[hour]) is a \tcdieroll{2d6} check. Faster speeds, rough seas, or high speed maneuvers increase the difficulty of the check.}
\skillentry{Drum Speak}{INT}{Nomad}{150}{N/A}{Small, specially formed drums are crafted by nomads to project sound up to three mets in fair weather (humid conditions can increase the distance carried to five mets, but heavy precipitation can cut the distance to a half a met). This skill is used to create and translate messages and inflections via drum noises. The GM will assign a skill check based on the complexity of the message. Loud noises at the source or destination of the sound obliterate the message and cannot be overcome with this skill.}
\skillentry{Dyeing}{INT}{Auger}{50}{2}{Dyeing is the infusion of color or colors into cloth. A dyer will know where to obtain specific dyestuffs, and can also aid in bleaching cloth.}
\skillentry{Embalming}{CSE}{Priest}{200}{0}{Used by Priests of Anubis to prepare the dead.}
\skillentry{Empathize}{CSE}{Auger}{20}{1}{This skill allows it possesor to carefully listen to the tales and woes of others, seemingly concerned and sympathetic to their problems. Listening to the inflection and voice of their target, the empethiser both learns new things about them and eases their troubles and mood.}
\skillentry{Escape}{INT}{Auger}{400}{4}{This skill is used to escape after being tied up. The player rolls \tcdieroll{2d6} against their adventurer's skill rank to work free from an average set of ropes. This roll may be modified by rope type, chains, locks and the adventurer's physical condition (GM discretion). If the check fails, more escapes may be tried, but subsequent checks are made with one additional \tcdieroll{d6} per failure.}
\skillentry{Falconry}{WIL}{Nomad}{350}{N/A}{Training and controlling small birds of prey are delicate and difficult tasks. This skill measures the ability to train such birds over a time period, and the ability to instruct a trained bird to perform a task. A \tcdieroll{2d6} check against the skill is usual; the GM will adjust this depending on the bird's tractability, the difficulty of the task, etc.}
\skillentry{Farming}{CSE}{Auger}{30}{2}{Farmers supply about one third the food used by Jaernian towns and cities, so this skill can be useful as a profession. Farming encompasses knowledge about planting, cultivation, and harvesting of crop plants. An adventurer with this skill might use the condition of crops as a clue to soil, weather, or unnatural conditions in a given area.}
\skillentry{Fencing Stolen Goods}{CSE}{Auger}{80}{4}{This skill is necessary to avoid detection while buying or re-selling stolen goods. A \tcdieroll{2d6} skill check is normal, but the GM will adjust this based on such factors as uniqueness of the item, its recognizability, T'orite activity in the vicinity, T'orite suspicion of the fencer, etc.}
\skillentry{Fencing Weapon}{AGI}{Marine}{350}{N/A}{This style of ritualistic combat uses small, light, flexible swords called foils or rapiers. These weapons are of virtually no use against armored opponents, or opponents with other weapons; attacks against such are at a -4 "to \indy{strike}," and the fencing weapon breaks on \ul{ANY} \indy{critical hit}. \indy{Marines}, however, often fence to resolve differences between themselves. Combatants in a fencing match wear \ul{light clothing}, and arm themselves with an appropriate fencing weapon. The fencing skill rank is used as a modifier in all rolls "to \indy{strike}." Foils and rapiers do \tcdieroll{1d6} \DP per hit.}
\skillentry{Fishing}{CSE}{Auger}{50}{2}{A hobby for many, fishing supplies at least half of the foodstuffs for most Jaernian cities and towns and therefore the skill can be used as a profession. This skill includes knowledge of small boats, nets, bait, location and movements of fish, and the storage and transport of caught fish.}
\skillentry{Flagging}{INT}{Marine}{100}{N/A}{Ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications are often accomplished with flags. A flagger holds a flag in each hand, and moves them in patterns to signify words or concepts. Red flags are used on clear days, and white flags on overcast days for best visibility. Concepts are often abbreviated to make flagging concise and quick, but are limited in vocabulary. If a message cannot be expressed ordinarily, Paroli alphabet characters can be flagged one by one. Succeeding a \tcdieroll{2d6} check against this skill conveys most ordinary messages within the standard flagging vocabulary (GM discretion). \ul{Simple concepts} are flagged twice as fast as ordinary speech, while \ul{spelling words} is four times slower than speech.}
\skillentry{Flail}{CSE}{Weapon}{270}{N/A}{Skilled usage of Flail grants the abilities listed under \indy[weapon!combat skill]{Combat Weapon Skills} on \tcpage{skill-combat-weapon}}
\skillentry{Fletching}{INT}{Auger}{50}{2}{Technically speaking, fletching allows an adventurer to finish arrows by adding flight control feathers to the shaft. Fletchers work closely with arrow makers, and it is not unusual to find one or the other with the ability to completely fashion arrows from scratch. A \tcdieroll{2d6} skill check is usual to successfully manufacture arrows (checked in lots of five or ten). Manufacture of \ul{unusual} missiles (larger than normal, made from non-standard materials, etc.) increases the difficulty.}
\skillentry{Flying}{AGI}{Marine}{400}{4}{This skill allows an actor or adventurer to control the orientation and movement of their body while utilizing the spell \indy{Flight}}

\skillentry{Wrestling}{CSE}{Marine}{180}{N/A}{This skill combines several different styles of unarmed hand to hand combat which can aid an adventurer when grappling an opponent. Any \ul{one} of these options may be used in a single combat round.\\

\indy{Clobbering}:  Using your fists and feet to knock an opponent to the ground, increasing an adventurer's chance to succeed at grapple "to \indy{hold}" an opponent. When the player has decided to grapple "to hold", they may at the same time roll \tcdieroll{1d6} for each bonus of \result{+2} that they want to add to their \indy{grapple} roll. If they succeeds the roll, they add bonus to their \tcdieroll{1d20} roll to grapple, and use the sum to determine the success of the grapple "to hold". \\

\indy{Heave}: When an adventurer attempts to "grapple to \indy{throw}" an opponent, they may use this skill to Heave the opponent farther than would be originally adjudicated by the game master. The player rolls \tcdieroll{1d6} for each additional \measure{5 feet} of distance they wish their adventurer to heave their opponent. The GM still adjudicates the resulting distance and damage (probably adding damage from a fall from a successful heave).\\

\indy{Pummel}: This can be used to harm a grappled opponent. After an opponent has been successfully grappled "to hold" in a previous round, and while that opponent is still \indy{held}. The player decides how many \tcdieroll{d6} of damage they wish to do to their opponent by \ul{kneeing, punching, slapping and jabbing} them.

The adventurer attempts to knock the opponent unconscious by hitting them in the head, or hitting their head against the ground. The player rolls \tcdieroll{4d6} vs this skill, and if successful, the opponent is \result{\indy{dazed} or \indy{unconscious} for \tcdieroll{1d6} rounds (rolled by the GM).}\\

\indy{Pin}: A skillful wrestler knows a number of holds which make it more difficult for their opponent to break free. To pin their opponent, the player rolls \tcdieroll{1d6} for each die of difficulty to add to their opponent's attempts to break free. If they succeed, any attempts to break the hold by their opponent \result{add \tcdieroll{1d6} per die rolled} until the grappler's next round.

\indy{Struggle}: When an adventurer has been held by being the target of a successful grapple "to \indy{hold}," and then attempts to break free, they can struggle to make the attempt easier.

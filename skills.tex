\label{ch:skills}
This chapter contains a list of all the standard skills, where they are applicable, and how they are adjudicated. Please be aware the the GM may modify any check as they see fit depending on the circumstances. If a skill does not list a specific die roll, the GM will assign an appropriate number of dice to check against the skill.

\begin{multicols*}{2}
\skillentry{Accounting}{INT}{Auger}{130}{4}{Keeping track of accounts and expenditures is important to the merchants and the larger establishments of Karfelon. Creative accounting also can be profitably employed among the less ethical.}	
\skillentry{Acrobatics}{AGI}{Marine}{200}{2}{This skill is useful for gymnastic flips, jumps, leaps, and swings. An adventurer can jump into, or backflip out of, melee. He could jump from a second story window into the street and gain a free round on an opponent. Acrobatics cannot be performed in any sort of metal armor.}	
\skillentry{Acting}{INT}{Nomad}{100}{2}{An adventurer with acting skill has some understanding of how to assume a role and stay in character. The GM must assign difficulties and appropriate checks for this skill based on circumstances.}	
\skillentry{Ambidextrous}{AGI}{Warrior}{150}{2}{An adventurer can use either hand as his primary attack hand. Adventurers, by default, have the same "handedness" as their player. If the adventurer's primary hand is incapacitated or damaged, this skill will let him fight using his secondary hand as if it were his primary hand. Normally, using a weapon in the secondary hand causes the adventurer to suffer a -4 penalty on any to "to strike" roll. Roll \tcdieroll{1d6} for each minus you wish to cancel against the skill rank. If successful, subtract the number of dice rolled from the -4 penalty.}	
\skillentry{Ambush}{INT}{Auger}{150}{2}{If your adventurer knows a person or group is coming, and if they are totally unaware of his presence or intentions, he can set an ambush for them. The GM will determine the amount of time necessary to set the ambush. Roll the skill rank or less on \tcdieroll{2d6}. If successful, the adventurer gets \tcdieroll{1d3} free rounds before normal combat begins.}	
\skillentry{Analyze Trap}{INT}{Auger}{150}{N/A}{An adventurer uses this skill to learn the workings of a set or unset trap. Most traps require a \colorbox{white!40!GreenYellow}{2d6} check against this skill to analyze successfully. If successful, subtract two dice from any attempt to disarm that trap. The GM may set a different roll for success depending on the difficulty of the trap.}	
\skillentry{Animal Calling}{HEA}{Auger}{80}{2}{Ever needful of quick gratification, this skill has been the boon to many lonely travelers. Out in the forests or fields, the sound of the skill user's voice lures unsuspecting woodland and field animals to the side of the caller, ready to become target practice, dinner, a new floor rug, or to meet even a more distasteful fate.}	
\skillentry{Animal Husbandry}{CSE}{Auger}{120}{3}{Domesticated animals (horses, cows, sheep, pigs, jkarr'n, ichitle, etc.) are needed in large numbers for food, transportation and work. Understanding how to raise these creatures successfully is a profitable profession.}	
\skillentry{Animal Training}{WIL}{Nomad}{200}{N/A}{The ability to train mammals to perform on command is regulated by the rank of this skill. It is useful in adventuring, or as a profession.}	
\skillentry{Archeology}{INT}{Auger}{100}{N/A}{This skill lets your adventurer use archeological methods and techniques, but does not give any historical information. Studying days or months on a site, he can determine patterns of lifestyle, diet, wealth, and other generalizations about the ancient inhabitants. On a spot examination, if you succeed the check against this skill, the race, time era, and other simple elementary data about the ancient inhabitants can be learned.}	
\skillentry{Architecture}{INT}{Auger}{65}{3}{Architecture involves the planning and design of buildings. An architect can also give advice on structural weaknesses and suggest repair options, if feasible. Architects always keep building plans as references for future work.}	
\skillentry{Armor Smithing}{INT}{Auger}{65}{2}{This skill is necessary to create and repair armor of all types. This includes some knowledge of working leather, iron, copper, fabrics, sewing and fastenings. Creating good quality armor of normal manufacture usually requires a two dice check, though temporarily repairing damaged armor in the field usually requires a one die check (GM discretion).}	
\skillentry{Arson}{INT}{Auger}{50}{2}{This is the ability to set fire to something and make it appear to have occurred naturally. The GM sets the number of \tcdieroll{d6} for the player to roll against the skill. If successful, anyone investigating the scene of the fire must make a PER check at \tcdieroll{2d6} more than usual to detect the arson.}	
\skillentry{Artillery}{INT}{Marine}{200}{2}{Ballistas, catapults and other artillery weapons are complex to load, aim and fire. An engineer or other adventurer may increase his skill using these weapons. This skill are a combination of different loading and firing styles that gives the artilleryman flexibility. Any ONE of these options can be used in one round. Since most of these weapons are very similar to use, this one skill can be applied to using any of artillery piece. The Quickload option lets the artilleryman load his weapon faster. Each round he is loading an artillery piece, or directing a team loading the weapon, if he can roll \tcdieroll{2d6} and get his artillery rank or less, that counts as two rounds of loading. He can not load and fire in the same round using this option. Knowing just how much to overwind, change aperture sizes or otherwise stress his weapon, the experienced artilleryman can make a Long Shot. He chooses the number of dice for an attempted shot, and rolls them. If the total matches or is less than his artillery skill, then his range increases 25\% of the original range for each die rolled. But this is not without danger. Any "roll to hit" of one indicates that he has overstressed his artillery piece, and it falls to pieces, possibly injuring those about it. A steady hand and a good eye help the artilleryman make a difficult Lethal Attack. Choosing a number of dice, the player rolls those dice. Getting a total of his artillery skill or less makes the number he needs to get a Critical Hit on his "roll to strike" one less for each die he rolled. If he rolls three dice and succeeds, he will score a critical hit on a 17 or better on his "roll to strike". Being able to very carefully set the angle and elevation of his weapon relative to the target, and in spite of the rolling deck, is what allows an artilleryman to make a Precise Attack. The player picks a number of dice, making the check against against his weapon skill. If this succeeds he may add 2 for each dice used in the check to the value of his "roll to strike" during this round.}	
\skillentry{Artistry}{CSE}{Auger}{80}{4}{Painting, sculpting, dancing, or executing any form of artistic expression requires this skill to avoid being laughed out of town as a rube or charlatan.}	
\skillentry{Assassination}{AGI}{Warrior}{500}{N/A}{This skill represents an organized and prepared attempt to kill a target. The preparations must be arranged at least one hour prior to the attack. Guards, security precautions, disguises, access to the site before the attempt and the accessibility of the target will all influence the number of dice which the GM will assign to the attempt. For physical melee attacks, if successful, the attacker rolls on the assassination column of the appropriate critical wound table. If the check fails, the attacker makes a normal melee roll instead. For other styles of killings, like poisonings and "arranged" accidents, the GM will determine the results of a success or a failure.}	
\skillentry{Astrology}{INT}{Nomad}{250}{RESERVED}{The trained astrologer looks at the position of the stars and the planets in the night sky. Some believe that future events can be divined by someone with this skill. The astrologer states what he is attempting to divine, and the GM assigns a number of \tcdieroll{d6} to roll against the skill rank for him to convince onlookers that what he says will come to pass.}	
\skillentry{Astronomy}{INT}{Auger}{115}{N/A}{Looking at the skies and cataloging the movements of the stars and planets is the province of the astronomer. This skill is needed to understand the movements of the heavens, and is often learned by sages, navigators, and nomad fortune readers.}	
\skillentry{Balance}{AGI}{Marine}{50}{2}{This ability is used to walk thin ledges, ropes, narrow walkways, etc. without falling. The GM may also ask for a check against balance when an adventurer tries many physical maneuvers that would test the balance of a normal person.}	
\skillentry{Barber}{AGI}{Auger}{15}{2}{Barbers cut hair and perform other personal grooming services. Wealthy citizens frequently train their own barber, or hire one skilled in these duties. Many free-lance barbers work out of the Natatorium.}	
\skillentry{Barristry}{INT}{Auger}{115}{RESERVED}{The barristry skill is useful if legal representation is needed, or if proper legal documents must be executed and filed. Such services can be quite costly, and many barristers grow rich from the legal woes of others.}	
\skillentry{Bartending}{CSE}{Auger}{30}{2}{The art of mixing palatable combinations of liquers and listening endlessly to repetitive conversation is important to those who must tend bars at various inns and taverns over the whole of Jaern.}	
\skillentry{Belching}{HEA}{Marine}{100}{2}{This skill has been brought to a fine art by bored marines who have been eating the onboard cooking too long. A high rank in this skill allows the talented belcher to sound off entire songs.}	
\skillentry{Binding}{CSE}{Auger}{50}{3}{When binding a target, choose how many more dice to add to the check for escape. Roll that many \tcdieroll{d6}; if you get your adventurer's skill rank or less, the bound person must add that many dice to a \tcdieroll{2d6} check against the escape skill to break free.}	
\skillentry{Blacksmithing}{STR}{Auger}{65}{3}{A blacksmith is skilled in forming utilitarian items from iron, such as nails, horseshoes, chains, etc. He is also experienced at attaching iron fittings to leather, and thus can fabricate and adjust horse tack and dolphin harnesses.}	
\skillentry{Bludgeon}{AGI}{Auger}{165}{N/A}{Bludgeon is the ability to knock an unsuspecting target unconscious by striking him from behind with a blunt instrument. The bludgeoner must position himself behind the target without the target having heard, seen or being aware in any way of the attacker. The GM will adjudicate the difficulty of the bludgeon based on factors such as alertness of the target, prevailing light conditions, and other distractions. If successful, roll on the Bludgeon Critical Hit Table in Appendix D. If the skill check fails, roll "to strike" against the target. If this roll succeeds, the target takes damage as normal (resolving all proper criticals and modifiers). If the roll "to strike" fails, the target of the bludgeon gets one free round to act before combat continues.}	
\skillentry{Boarding}{AGI}{Marine}{100}{2}{This is the ability to move safely and quickly from one ship to another, especially to a hostile vessel. This may involve lots of rope swinging, careful jumping, and rigging running, which are all encompassed in this skill.}	
\skillentry{Botany}{INT}{Auger}{30}{N/A}{Botany is necessary to understand and implement the requirements for healthy plant growth. A botanist can advise on proper fertilization, watering, pruning, etc., as well as diagnose and perhaps cure plant diseases.}	
\skillentry{Brewing}{INT}{Auger}{80}{RESERVED}{This skill has been carefully handed down, father to son, since antiquity. The secrets of using just the right materials to assure the proper fermentation of the grains have been closely held by those in the brewers guild. This profession is highly profitable to one who can find a way to gain admittance to its ranks.}	
\skillentry{Bricklaying}{INT}{Auger}{50}{2}{Mixing, layiing and mortering bricks is vital to the construction of new buildings and public works. The bricklayer is in demaind on all such construction projects, both making the bricks and laying them out carefully allong the wall lines and areas specified by the architech.}	
\skillentry{Build Trap}{INT}{Auger}{250}{N/A}{Anyone wanting to build and arm mechanical traps should have this skill. Magical effects can be bound to such traps using the rules for creating magical items.}	
\skillentry{Butchering}{CSE}{Auger}{30}{2}{This skill is necessary for the efficient cutting of an animal carcass into usable meat. A butcher (i.e., one who uses this skill as a profession) can identify spoiled meat before others can, and is an expert at putting a razor sharp edge on a knife.}	
\skillentry{Camouflage}{CSE}{Auger}{50}{2}{This skill is the deliberate and specific concealment of one or more persons in the wild. A substantial amount of time may be required to gather and prepare all the needed materials. As a guide, allow \tcdieroll{3d6}+3 turns per person to be concealed.}	
\skillentry{Candlemaking}{INT}{Auger}{15}{2}{Basic candlemaking involves the repetitive dipping of a fabric wick in tallow to create a longlasting light source.}	
\skillentry{Carpentry}{INT}{Auger}{50}{2}{This skill is crucial to the construction of wooden objects, buildings, or vehicles. The proper use of tools, materials and knowledge of their joinings allow the hard working carpenter to make a reasonable living from his craft. Attempts to create or repair wooden items can be ajudicated by checks against this skill.}	
\skillentry{Cartography}{INT}{Marine}{100}{3}{Cartography is the making, care, reading, copying, and interpretation of maps. A successful \tcdieroll{1d6} skill check is required to read the basics of a map well enough to follow established paths and roadways. Without this skill, a \tcdieroll{4d6} check versus INT is required. To travel off the beaten path with the aid of a map, a player needs to make a successful \tcdieroll{2d6} skill check. (As well as a successful Orienteering check to keep from getting lost.)}	
\skillentry{Cartwrighting}{INT}{Auger}{50}{3}{A cartwright posses special carpentry skills to assemble and repair carts and wagons. He cannot make wooden wheels, however.}	
\skillentry{Climbing}{STR}{Marine}{100}{2}{This skill is used for climbing ropes, scaling rough walls, etc. The GM will set the difficulty of the check based on the circumstances of the climb.}	
\skillentry{Cobbling}{INT}{Auger}{50}{2}{Cobbling involves the construction and repair of leather footwear. The amount of time required and the difficulty of the check depends on the type of footwear. A pair of rope-soled sandals take about one day, whereas a pair of thigh length, jacer hide boots with secret compartments in the heels and soles could take two weeks or more.}	
\skillentry{Composing Music}{CSE}{Nomad}{250}{0}{Creating melody, harmony and rhythm from the chaos of life all around, the composer puts quill to paper to creae music that he and others can perform.}	
\skillentry{Cooking}{INT}{Auger}{15}{2}{This skill allows the preparation of edible and attractive foods and drinks. A check of \tcdieroll{2d6} is reasonable to prepare a plain but tasty meal. A check of \tcdieroll{4d6} is appropriate to prepare a successful feast for a large crowd, or to make a very exotic dish.}	
\skillentry{Coopering}{INT}{Auger}{65}{2}{A cooper fashions watertight wooden containers, such as barrels, kegs, buckets, etc. The skill includes the ability to select the proper wood, make beveled joints, and use metal bands to clamp and reinforce the item.}	
\skillentry{Courtesan}{COM}{Auger}{115}{2}{This skill is used to please other people in various physical and sexual ways. Skill as a evening companion and well as the well directed use of lust are included within. A check of \tcdieroll{2d6} is considered when attempting to please a companion. A check of \tcdieroll{3d6} vs this skill is usual for attempting to entice someone into a situation, but remember the circumstances can cause the GM to modify this check.}	
\skillentry{Cyphering}{INT}{Auger}{115}{N/A}{Cyphering is encoded writing. It is frequently used in business correspondence, communication with the Assassins Guild, and between maraujo captains. Cyphering can be used to create or break codes. To create a code, the player selects a number of \tcdieroll{d6} to roll against the skill rank. If he gets his adventurer's skill rank or less the code is useable, and the number of \tcdieroll{d6} rolled becomes the code's difficulty rating. If the check is failed, the code is flawed and will yield gibberish or misleading statements if used. To break a code, the player rolls a number of \tcdieroll{d6} equal to his adventurer's cyphering rank. The GM rolls a number of \tcdieroll{d6} equal to the code's difficulty. The higher total wins, i.e., if the player is higher he breaks the code, and if the GM is higher, the code remains insoluble. If the player knows the key word or phrase used to construct the code, the player rolls a number of \tcdieroll{d6} equal to one less than the code's difficulty (if the code is difficulty 6, the player rolls \tcdieroll{5d6} and the GM \tcdieroll{6d6}) regardless of his adventurer's cyphering rank. The role of player and GM can of course be reversed in the above examples if an actor is trying to break a player-created code.}	
\skillentry{Dagger Fighting}{CSE}{Marine}{120}{N/A}{This weapon skill allows greater proficiency in hand-to-hand combat with a dagger. Like other weapon skills, options for Quickdraw, MultiAttack, Precise Attack, Lethal Attack, and Effective Attack can be used as described for Combat Weapon Skills.}	
\skillentry{Dagger Throwing}{CSE}{Marine}{60}{N/A}{This proficiency skill assists in targeting thrown daggers. Roll the number of dice equal to the bonus desired. If the total is equal to or less than your adventurer's skill rank, add that bonus to the "to hit" roll, but not the damage roll.}	
\skillentry{Dancing}{AGI}{Nomad}{100}{1}{The dancing skill is used to execute pleasing footwork patterns and body motions, usually to musical accompaniment. Success at this skill indicates the dancer has enjoyed the activity and has appeared to be competent at the appropriate level of difficulty depending on the assigned skill check (GM discretion, considering the intricacy of the dance).}	
\skillentry{Detect Traps}{PER}{Auger}{150}{4}{This skill allows an adventurer to observe a suspicious area and determine if, and how, it is trapped. The area must be in the adventurer's LOS, and the difficulty of the check depends not only on how cunningly the trap design is but also visibility.}	
\skillentry{Diagnosis}{INT}{Auger}{80}{RESERVED}{Someone adept at diagnosis can determine what is physically wrong with a person, though a remedy or treatment suggestion is outside the scope of this skill. Diagnosis can be developed into a very lucrative profession when used in conjunction with the nomadic herbology skill.}	
\skillentry{Disarm Trap}{INT}{Auger}{250}{N/A}{Having identified a trap by some means, this skill allows one attempt to disarm it. Average mechanical traps require a \tcdieroll{2d6} check to successfully disarm. Magic, technology, and trap difficulty can all change this check at the GM's discretion. Failure to disarm may trigger the trap (GM discretion).}	
\skillentry{Disguise}{INT}{Auger}{50}{3}{This is the ability to skillfully apply makeup, false beards, etc., and select and wear clothing to change one's outward appearance. The GM will determine the difficulty of the check based on how much the desired result varies from the physical characteristics of the adventurer. Simply adding a beard is very easy, but to disguise a human as another race can be exceedingly difficult.}	
\skillentry{Diving}{STR}{Marine}{50}{2}{Diving allows an adventurer to properly dive into water from greater heights, or into shallow water, with less chance of injury than someone without it. As a base, an unskilled person cannot dive into less than 10 feet of water safely, and will likely be injured if diving from a height of more than 10 feet. The GM determines the difficulty of the skill check. A dive from 30 feet into 10 feet of water would be a \tcdieroll{2d6} check against the skill; dives from greater heights or into shallower water increases the difficulty. The depth of the dive may also be adjusted with this skill. Normal dive depth is 10 feet, regardless of height. If the adventurer wishes he may have the depth of the dive equal the height of the dive to a maximum of 30 feet; minimum depth is two feet. Such depth changes add \tcdieroll{1d6} to the skill check.}	
\skillentry{Dodging}{AGI}{Marine}{200}{4}{This skill allows your adventurer to dodge incoming missiles. This is done in the opponent's round when the GM is about to roll "to strike" your adventurer. When the GM asks for his MDV, announce that he is dodging, and roll the number of dice equal to the number you wish to increase his MDV. If successful, state the MDV plus the number of dice rolled. Otherwise, state the MDV minus the number of dice rolled.}	
\skillentry{Dolphin Speech}{INT}{Marine}{300}{N/A}{Some believe dolphins are as intelligent as humans, but most think of them more like children. Dolphins communicate among themselves with a series of clicks, whistles, and grunts. Over time people can learn to understand and even "speak" some of the simpler "words." Trying to convey a simple idea, or understand one spoken by a dolphin, requires a successful \tcdieroll{2d6} check against this skill. Your GM will modify this roll depending on the complexity of the communication, and the current circumstances.}	
\skillentry{Dolphin Training}{CSE}{Marine}{400}{RESERVED}{Dolphins can become very intelligent and loyal mounts if skillfully trained. Dolphin trainers are highly prized and sought by Maraujo cefos to train their cavalries, and can demand and get high fees for their services.}	
\skillentry{Dolphinship}{AGI}{Marine}{200}{3}{This skill allows an adventurer to control and ride a properly trained and harnessed dolphin. Riding a dolphin at half the creature's speed through a calm sea is a \tcdieroll{2d6} check. Faster speeds, rough seas, or high speed maneuvers increase the difficulty of the check.}	
\skillentry{Drum Speak}{INT}{Nomad}{150}{N/A}{Small, specially formed drums are crafted by nomads to project sound up to three mets in fair weather (humid conditions can increase the distance carried to five mets, but heavy precipitation can cut the distance to a half a met.) This skill is used to create and translate messages and inflections via drum noises. The GM will assign a skill check based on the complexity of the message. Loud noises at the source or destination of the sound obliterate the message and cannot be overcome with this skill.}	
\skillentry{Dyeing}{INT}{Auger}{50}{2}{Dyeing is the infusion of color or colors into cloth. A dyer will know where to obtain specific dyestuffs, and can also aid in bleaching cloth.}	
\skillentry{Embalming}{CSE}{Priest}{200}{0}{Used by Priests of Anubis}	
\skillentry{Empathize}{CSE}{Auger}{20}{1}{This skill allows it possesor to carefulle listen to the tales and woes of others, seemingly concerned and sympathetic to their problems. Listening to the inflection and voice of his target, the empethiser both learns new things about them and eases their troubles and mood.}	
\skillentry{Escape}{INT}{Auger}{400}{4}{This skill is used to escape after being tied up. The player rolls \tcdieroll{2d6} against his adventurer's skill rank to work free from an average set of ropes. This roll may be modified by rope type, chains, locks and the adventurer's physical condition (GM discretion). If the check fails, more escapes may be tried, but subsequent checks are made with one additional \tcdieroll{d6} per failure.}	
\skillentry{Falconry}{WIL}{Nomad}{350}{N/A}{Training and controlling small birds of prey are delicate and difficult tasks. This skill measures the ability to train such birds over a time period, and the ability to instruct a trained bird to perform a task. A \tcdieroll{2d6} check against the skill is usual; the GM will adjust this depending on the bird's tractability, the difficulty of the task, etc.}	
\skillentry{Farming}{CSE}{Auger}{30}{2}{Farmers supply about one third the food used by Jaernian towns and cities, so this skill can be useful as a profession. Farming encompasses knowledge about planting, cultivation, and harvesting of crop plants. An adventurer with this skill might use the condition of crops as a clue to soil, weather, or unnatural conditions in a given area.}	
\skillentry{Fencing/Merchant}{CSE}{Auger}{80}{4}{This skill is necessary to avoid detection while buying or re-selling stolen goods. A \tcdieroll{2d6} skill check is normal, but the GM will adjust this based on such factors as uniqueness of the item, its recognizability, T'orite activity in the vicinity, T'orite suspicion of the fencer, etc.}	
\skillentry{Fencing}{AGI}{Marine}{350}{N/A}{This style of ritualistic combat uses small, light, flexible swords called foils or rapiers. These weapons are of virtually no use against armored opponents, or opponents with other weapons; attacks against such are at a -4 "to strike," and the fencing weapon breaks on ANY critical hit. Marines, however, often fence to resolve differences between themselves. Combatants in a fencing match wear light clothing, and arm themselves with an appropriate fencing weapon. The fencing skill rank is used as a modifier in all rolls "to strike." Foils and rapiers do \tcdieroll{1d6} DP per hit.}	
\skillentry{Fishing}{CSE}{Auger}{50}{2}{A hobby for many, fishing supplies at least half of the foodstuffs for most Jaernian cities and towns and therefore the skill can be used as a profession. This skill includes knowledge of small boats, nets, bait, location and movements of fish, and the storage and transport of caught fish.}	
\skillentry{Flagging}{INT}{Marine}{100}{N/A}{Ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications are often accomplished with flags. A flagger holds a flag in each hand, and moves them in patterns to signify words or concepts. Red flags are used on clear days, and white flags on overcast days for best visibility. Concepts are often abbreviated to make flagging concise and quick, but are limited in vocabulary. If a message cannot be expressed ordinarily, Paroli alphabet characters can be flagged one by one. Succeeding a \tcdieroll{2d6} check against this skill conveys most ordinary messages within the standard flagging vocabulary (GM discretion). Simple concepts are flagged twice as fast as ordinary speech, while spelling words is four times slower than speech.}	
\skillentry{Fletching}{INT}{Auger}{50}{2}{Technically speaking, fletching allows an adventurer to finish arrows by adding flight control feathers to the shaft. Fletchers work closely with arrow makers, and it is not unusual to find one or the other with the ability to completely fashion arrows from scratch. A \tcdieroll{2d6} skill check is usual to successfully manufacture arrows (checked in lots of five or ten). Manufacture of unusual missiles (larger than normal, made from non-standard materials, etc.) increases the difficulty.}	
\skillentry{Flying}{AGI}{Marine}{400}{4}{This skill allows an actor or adventurer to control the orientation and movement of their body while utilizing the spell Flight}	
\skillentry{Forestry}{INT}{Auger}{30}{2}{Forestry involves the nurturing and management of trees, including the cutting of appropriate trees for lumber to make room for new growth. A basic knowledge of different tree species, their requirements, and uses are subsumed in this skill.}	
\skillentry{Forgery}{INT}{Auger}{250}{4}{A skilled forger can duplicate signatures, papers, paper currency, or documents. Attempts at forging are made at a number of dice against the skill rank. Forging a signature is perhaps the easiest (\tcdieroll{2d6} check), while documents might be \tcdieroll{3d6} and currency \tcdieroll{5d6} (GM's discretion).}	
\skillentry{Gambling}{CSE}{Auger}{50}{2}{The gambling skill allows an adventurer to have a better chance at beating the odds in games of chance. Gambling is simulated by the GM (the "house") and the adventurer's player rolling dice against each other, the higher total winning the wager. The GM usually rolls \tcdieroll{5d6}. An adventurer with no gambling skill rolls \tcdieroll{1d6}; each rank in the skill adds a \tcdieroll{d6}. Some games of chance are far more difficult (or highly rigged in favor of the house), so the GM may roll upwards of \tcdieroll{10d6}. Also, if the GM is portraying an actor with gambling skill, he would roll twice, once for the "house" and once for the actor. Under specific roleplaying circumstances, either the player or the GM may ask to roleplay the game of chance rather than relying on dice for the outcome.}	
\skillentry{Gardening}{INT}{Auger}{15}{2}{Gardening is similar to farming, though on a smaller scale and dealing with vegetables, herbs, shrubberies, flowers, and the like rather than field crops. The skill subsumes knowledge of garden plants, their growth requirements, and uses. Gardening can be used as trade, from selling produce to tending the private gardens of the wealthy.}	
\skillentry{Glassblowing}{INT}{Auger}{50}{N/A}{A glassblower creates glass containers by blowing air through a hollow pipe into a blob of molten glass, then twirling or rolling the glass until it hardens. The skill can be a lucrative profession.}	
\skillentry{Heraldry}{INT}{Auger}{50}{N/A}{Heraldry involves the recording and awarding of coats of arms for nobles. Heralds are often consulted to settle disputes over royal bloodlines and to decide who is entitled to display a coat of arms. Thus they are quite knowledgeable about noble ancestry, including the black sheep and closeted skeletons the nobility would just as soon forget. The skill is used to ferret out and verify information that will prove a given bloodline. The GM will set the difficulty of the check based on such factors as the availability and accessibility of written documents, living witnesses, etc.}	
\skillentry{Herbology}{INT}{Nomad}{250}{RESERVED}{Herbologists collect, classify, purify, and sell reagents derived from plants. The work is delicate and exacting; done improperly a potentially beneficial reagent can become a deadly poison. An herbologist can serve as a physician (of sorts) to cure minor ailments (dyspepsia, headache, diarrhea, etc.), though he cannot restore lost DP with his nostrums and extracts.}	
\skillentry{Herding}{CSE}{Auger}{30}{1}{The herding skill is used to control groups of domesticated animals, such as cattle, sheep, etc.}	
\skillentry{Hiding}{AGI}{Auger}{50}{3}{The adventurer can use available cover (walls, corners, rubbish, furniture) to avoid being seen, or to conceal an object. A \tcdieroll{2d6} check against the skill is usual, but the GM will modify this based on the size of the person or object to be hidden versus the type and amount of cover available. It is possible that the result will be something less than full concealment. A \tcdieroll{2d6} check against PER is normal to notice something. The GM may adjust PER rolls if the person or object is quarter concealed (+\tcdieroll{1d6}); half concealed (+\tcdieroll{2d6}), or fully concealed (+\tcdieroll{3d6}). This skill can be used under any lighting conditions.}	
\skillentry{Horse Training}{WIL}{Auger}{150}{N/A}{A horse trainer attempts to curb the wildness of a horse to make it comfortable around people, but breaking and training wild horses for riding and farming duties can be hazardous if you don't know what you're doing. This skill is in great demand around any large village or town. A \tcdieroll{2d6} check is normal, though the GM will adjust this based on the fractiousness of the beast in question. Failure might result in injury to the adventurer (GM discretion).}	
\skillentry{Horsemanship}{CSE}{Auger}{100}{2}{This is the ability to ride a horse, or to handle a team of horses.

\skillentry{Wrestling}{CSE}{Marine}{180}{N/A}{This skill combines several different styles of unarmed hand to hand combat which can aid an adventurer when grappling an opponent. Any one of these options may be used in a single combat round. Clobbering is using your fists and feet to knock an opponent to the ground, increasing an adventurer's chance to succeed at "grapple to hold" and opponent. When the player has decided to "grapple to hold", he may at the same time roll \tcdieroll{1d6} for each bonus of 2 that he wants to add to his grapple roll. If he succeeds the roll, he adds the sought number to his \tcdieroll{d20} roll to grapple, and uses the sum to determine the success of the "grapple to hold". When an adventurer attempts to "grapple to throw" an opponent, he may use this skill to Heave the opponent farther than would be originally adjudicated by the game master. The player rolls \tcdieroll{1d6} for each additional 5' of distance he wishes his adventurer to heave his opponent. The GM still adjudicates the resulting distance and damage (probably adding damage from a fall from a successful heave). Pummel can only be used after an opponent has been successfully "grappled to hold" in a previous round, and while that opponent is still held. The player decides how many \tcdieroll{d6} of damage he wishes his adventurer to do to his opponent by kneeing, punching, slapping and jabbing him. Then the player rolls twice that number of \tcdieroll{d6}. If he matches or gets less than the rank in this skill, he does the desired number of \tcdieroll{d6} of damage to his opponent. Like a pummel, a Cosh can only be performed after the opponent is still being held. The adventurer attempts to knock the opponent unconscious by hitting him in the head, or hitting his head against the ground. The Player rolls \tcdieroll{4d6} vs this skill, and if successful, the opponent is dazed or unconscious for \tcdieroll{1d6} rounds (rolled by the GM). A skillful wrestler knows a number of holds which make it more difficult for his opponent to break free. To Pin his opponent, the player rolls one \tcdieroll{d6} for each dice he wants to increase his opponent's attempts to break free. If he succeeds, the opponent attempts to break the hold are that many dice more difficult until the next time the adventure has a round. The player needs to recheck this hold every round for it to stay in effect. When an adventurer has been held by being the target of a successful "grapple to hold", and then attempts to break free, he can Struggle to make the attempt easier.
